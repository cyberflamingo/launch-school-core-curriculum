  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn
  <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a
  <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href=
  "https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot!
  Why don't you join me?</p>
  <p class="more-text">There's not a lot of material on this page
  as I'm playing around with HTML & CSS. When I'm done, these last
  two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the
  "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will
  help accomplish that.</p>
  <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">This is the final
  paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an `id`
  attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline
  the entire paragraph.</p>
