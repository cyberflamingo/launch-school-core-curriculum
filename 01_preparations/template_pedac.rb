== (Understand the) Problem

Essential to understanding how to solve a problem. In order to be able to
solve a problem, you have to at least understand what the problem is and what
it is asking. Take some time to allow the problem to load into your brain.
Don't rush this.

First, identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem

* Inputs:
  1.
  2.
* Output:
  1.

---

Check for Problem Domain: the Problem Domain is the area of expertise or
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. Basically any
domain-specific terms or concepts that may be applicable.
It limits the scope of the problem.
For example, if the problem asks you to add up a set of multiples, you need to
make sure you know what multiples are.
Could one word have multiple meanings? etc

*Problem Domain:*


---

Check for Implicit Requirements. Are there requirements that are not
explicitly stated?

*Implicit Requirements:*


---

Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better
understand the problem.

*Clarifying Questions:*

1.
2.
3.

A mental model is an explanation of someone's thought process about how
something works in the real world. Think of it as a summary of the "entire
problem" written in your own words.
It is your perspective of *what* the problem requires--not *how*. How is
implemented in the Algorithm section.
As a rule of thumb, you can keep the number of mental models to one if it
fully, and accurately, captures the requirements of the problem.

== Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases

The objective is to come up with examples that validate your understanding of
the problem, and confirm that you are working in the right direction.
Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of a process, or a
person.

*Examples:*

* Example 1
  * Inputs:
    1.
    2.
  * Output
    1.
* Example 2
  * Inputs:
    1.
    2.
  * Output
    1.

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are oftentimes an excellent place to find
test cases. If you're working with collections, it's a good idea to find test
cases that deal with zero, one or multiple elements in the collection.
Try to provide test cases that handle any edge cases you can find.
If you're working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that
deal with zero, one or multiple elements in the collection.

*Your Test Cases:*

* Example 3
  * Inputs:
    1.
    2.
  * Output
    1.

---

Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.
For example: problems that involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that
are at both ends of the range. Typically can involve working with negative
numbers, 0, or extremely high values.

*Your Edge Cases:*

* Example 4
  * Inputs:
    1.
    2.
  * Output
    1.

== Data Structure

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to
the desired output.
The chief considerations here are your intended programming language and your
mental model.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.

---

== Algorithm

Start with your mental model if you have one. While you're still learning to
solve problems, it would be a good idea to consistently create mental models
to assist you.
Otherwise you can start with your Data Structure, and think about how you'd
build and manipulate it to get to the output. For example, if you're going to
use an array maybe you would want to focus on constructing or iterating over a
collection.
The chief objective here is to determine a series of instructions that will
transform the input into the desired output.

* The challenge is to get to the right amount of detail (think about the
steps to creating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.)
* You want something that you can readily convert to code without actually
writing code.
* Before implementing the algorithm, you should test it manually with test
cases.
